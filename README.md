# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim


I mean not to confuse you with all the lazyvim config I have here I was using 
packer then move to Lazy. the `init.lua` config was the time I was learning lazy 
and getting my head wrap around it numerous Keymap. this repo however is my new stable config 
and I will be extending it gracefully to suit my taste feel free to poke around you might learn or teach 
me a few new things. 
I have added some powerful keymap to help you increase your productivity 
To get started with this repo please check out the  [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) 

After that all I did here should make sense to you.
